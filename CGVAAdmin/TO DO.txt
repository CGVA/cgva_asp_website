BIRTH_DATE to smalldatetime in PERSON_TBL
ADD ACTIVE FLAG for RATER_TBL
change decimal to 5,2,2 length, precision, scale in RATINGS_TBL
I added the extra columns to the REGISTRATION_TBL
ratings history table?


12/7/2007
I added ID column to Registration table for ease of modifying records
I added ID column to Match Game table for ease of modifying records
TEAM1_MVP_ID MatchSchedule - needs to be nullable as the MVP wont be known when the match is set up   
TEAM2_MVP_ID MatchSchedule - needs to be nullable as the MVP wont be known when the match is set up      


X	redo all validation for modify screens to be like the registration.asp page - UGH!
X	MAINTAIN - I should be able to see, but not change the PERSON_ID  from the maintenance screen. 
X	ADD & MAINTAIN - Validate the email address.
X	ADD - What if I have two people with the same first and last name, how will I know which one to pick from this screen. Are you keeping that from happening in the person_tbl maintenance, if so, then we are okay. (Add Person ID to the DDLs).
x	validate the date entry field(that it is a date) Week.asp
x	validate the court number entry field(that it is an integer) MatchSchedule.asp

X	PERSON_TBL - validate logical delete indicator to other affected tables
x	player ratings - cant make all people have a rating just to update one person's rating
x	player ratings - add new records to the table for a person who's rating info has been updated
X	TeamMember.asp - top list of all players, remaining players (7-10) only available players not on other teams
x	player ratings - watch db error thrown on adding same person, date, rater 1 with new rating
x	player ratings - only display most recent rating for a person
x	player ratings - allow ability to add notes to existing record, without having to change a persons rating, eff date, rater #1
X	MatchGame add match time to the DDLs
X	Registration - modify screen is SLOW
X	Registration - modify to only pull active events
X	Person - modify screen is SLOW
X	Ratings - modify screen is SLOW (because of Person DDL)
X	MatchGame - add time column to upper display and sort by division, time, game
x	TeamMember_submit.asp - trap for adding the same person twice to the same team 
x	MatchGame trap for adding same game # to the same match more than once	
x	Week - only show active events in DDL
x	Time - only show active events in DDL

x	modify event table to add/modify week ind
x	event - validate modify  to prevent two events with same code
x	location - validate modify  to prevent two locations with same code

x	MatchSchedule trap for adding more than one match to the same time and court, regardless of teams

x	add double forfeit indicator to match game table

3/30
x	add ref forfeit indicator to match game table
x	handle ref forfeit indicator in results display

4/25
x	add role type screen
x	add person access screen
x	add security to all pages
	





	add photos to person table (PHOTO_FILENAME varchar(20))
	add	'through week x' for fragStandings header'
	- Replacement webpage for:
	    Schedules
x	    Teams
x	    Statistics
	

	automatically add browse to person access table for all new people
	update person access table with 'browse' for all current people
	redirect people to the appropriate start page based on login credentials
	
	
	incorporate graphics into template
	

	add a ratings history search (by person)
	TeamMember.asp - view all teams within a division (later)
	Delete ability - Division
	Delete ability - Event
	Delete ability - Event_Type
	Delete ability - First_Contact 
	Delete ability - Location 
	Delete ability - Rater 
	Delete ability - Ratings
	Delete ability - Registration (watch other tables integrity)

	MatchSchedule delete ability(watch foreign key to games table)
	revamp MatchSchedule to be - select a week, show all matches for that week plus an add new at the bottom
	
	certified refs report. The person responsible for managing referee certification will 
	want a list of all certified refs, those in progress, certification start and 
	expiration dates, and possibly contact info so that he or she can recruit upper 
	division refs as mentors to those in lower divisions. I suppose that report should also 
	contain location, team and division to facilitate scheduling of volunteers. The league 
	directors will want similar info but only to ensure that each team has at least one 
	certified ref. Maybe that last bit could be just another indicator column in the 
	registration report that you and Charlie are currently working on. But, make sure that 
	there is a provision for showing a difference between certified, in progress, expiring 
	this league, and already expired.

X	We'll also want a ratings report. At the moment, the only use for this would be to 
	double-check that all info from the ratings spreadsheet was input into the database. 
	It's not that I don't trust you guys, it's that mistakes and omissions always happen.
	
	
	


add 	- Report/Screen to show Registered/Paid players per Event. This would be used by 
date	anyone on the board to see who is currently registered for an event for 
filter	planning.

x	- Report/Screen to show Full Player list per Event by Division and Team.  This 
	would show the breakdown of players by team and division with emails/contact 
	info.

x	- Export to excel of database contact information in total OR per event.  This 
	would be used by anyone who needs the whole database (ie: P/R, League Director, 
	etc).

Hi John,
 
SO here are my notes (and other ideas) for tables from our meeting.  
Let me know what you think of the field and table names.  
I thought that the division_ref_tbl could be just a button_ref_tbl 
if we need to reference buttons in other places.
 
New tables:
 
* = Existing field in another table with a datatype we should use.
 
USER_LOGIN_TBL
PERSON_ID *
USERNAME
PASSWORD
SECURITY_QUESTION
REMINDER
ANSWER
 
 
ROLE_TYPE_TBL
ROLE_TYPE
ROLE_TYPE_DESC
 
(The following ROLE_TYPE values we defined: "ADMIN","BOD","BROWSE","EDIT")
 
I decided to add description field so as we add things we can annotate on what pages 
they will be used.
 
 
PERSON_ACCESS_TBL
PERSON_ID *
ROLE_TYPE * (above)
 
 
USER_LOGIN_LOG_ENTRY_TBL
ENTRY_USERNAME * (above)
ENTRY_PASSWORD
ENTRY_DATETIME 
ENTRY_SUCCESS_IND ('Y' or 'N')
 
BUTTON_REF_TBL
BUTTON_REF_STRING
BUTTON_FILENAME
