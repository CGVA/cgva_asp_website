	<p align='left'><strong>Registration Now Open for Thursday-Night  Summer Indoor Volleyball Leagues Co-Sponsored by CGVA!<br />
	</strong><br />
	  *** By popular demand, the 4-person league is  now pre-formed team, as is the 2-person league ***<br />
	  <br />
	  Shane  Speciale, with assistance and support from CGVA, is happy to announce that he  is offering two indoor volleyball leagues this summer.&nbsp; Both leagues  (4-person and 2-person) will be pre-formed teams. Advance  registration is both accepted and encouraged (by email and USPS), so hurry,  even if you do not have a team, as <strong>SPACE  IS LIMITED</strong> &ndash; <a href="../CGVADOCS/LEAGUE/2009 Summer Thursday League Team Registration Form.pdf" target="_blank" title="CGVA Summer Thursday Registration Form">click here</a> for the electronic registration form (you have the option to submit/email your  completed form rather than printing it). Advance registration must be received  no later than Friday, May 1.&nbsp; On-site registration will be accepted on  Thursday, May 7, provided space is still available.<br />
	  <br />
	  The leagues  will be held Thursday nights at the University of Denver Gates Field House  starting with registration and open play on May 7, and will then continue for  ten (10) weeks, followed by two weeks of tournament play ending on August 5  (with a bye the week of July 6). The leagues  will be considerably less formal than the Fall and Spring CGVA leagues, as,  among other things, teams will be self-reffing, there will be no MVPs or  awards, and a liberal substitution policy will be applied. The leagues will be  open to all levels of play (A/BB, B, and C) and will be separated into  divisions if the level of participation allows.<br />
      <br />
	  The cost for the 4-person league is $65, and the cost for the 2-person league  is $95 (credit card payments for the summer leagues will be accepted via PayPal  in advance).<br />
	  <br />
	  This is a  great way to keep your skills fresh [in an air-conditioned facility] while  having fun over the summer, so we hope you can take part. <br />
	  For  more information, please email Shane, who will be acting as the League  Director, at <a href="mailto:shane@avanzasystems.com">shane@avanzasystems.com</a>.  This is also open to individuals who have not previously played in a CGVA  league, so please feel free to forward to anyone you know who might be interested.  Please note that, depending on the level of interest in each league, the number  of teams may be capped and/or the 2-person league may be moved to an alternate  night/venue, so please register early.</p>
