    <br />
    CGVA is happy to announce that registration is now open for  its two Thursday-night indoor volleyball leagues this summer.&nbsp; Advance  online registration (even if you do not have a team) is both accepted and  encouraged, so hurry, as SPACE IS LIMITED, and the leagues filled quickly last  year.&nbsp; To register, click on MyCGVA, then log in and click on My  Events.&nbsp; After following the prompts and paying via PayPal, be sure to  click on the Return to CGVA link in PayPal or your payment will not post  correctly.&nbsp; If you are a captain, you can then form your team(s) and  assign registered players by clicking on My Teams in MyCGVA.</p>
    <p><strong>Open Play and On-Site Registration:</strong>&nbsp; Thursday,  April 22, 6:30PM &ndash; 11:00PM.&nbsp; Please note that registration will only be  available on April 22 if the leagues do not fill beforehand.&nbsp; Otherwise,  open play will be limited to registered teams.</p>
    <p><strong>League Play:</strong>&nbsp; 10 weeks of regular play starting  Thursday, May 6, followed by the two-week league tournament July 15th and  22nd.&nbsp; There will be no play on April 29th.</p>
    <p><strong>Format(s):</strong>&nbsp; Pre-formed 4-player and 2-player  teams.</p>
    <p><strong>Divisions:</strong>&nbsp; 2/3, 4, and 5/6 (as registration  permits).</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp; University of Denver&rsquo;s Gates Field  House</p>
    <p><strong>Cost:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4-Person &ndash; $65/person;  2-Person &ndash; $95/person (credit cards will be accepted via PayPal in advance)</p>
    <p><strong>Parking Permits:</strong> Parking permits for the season are  available for $10 per permit (checks should be made payable to University of  Denver). Players will need to provide the make, model, year, color, license  plate, and email address for the vehicle they seek a permit for.&nbsp; The  permit parking garage is on the south side of Asbury across the street from the  Gates Field House, and the uncovered permit lot is due east.&nbsp; Unlike years  past, parking permits will be emailed to applicants directly, which should  result in a more rapid turnaround.&nbsp; The last day for permit requests is  5/6/10!</p>
    <p><strong>Referees: </strong>&nbsp;Teams will be self-reffing, and there  will be no awards/MVPs.</p>
    <p><strong>Substitutes:</strong>&nbsp; Anyone playing in either league  may be used as a substitute, regardless of format or rating.&nbsp; For 4&rsquo;s, at  least two members of the original team must be present to avoid a  forfeit.&nbsp; For 2&rsquo;s, one member of the original team must be present to  avoid a forfeit.</p>
