	    <div align="center"><strong>NAGVA Santioned Tournament Changes </strong><br /></div>
Two critical changes began June 2008 for NAGVA sanctioned  tournaments like Last Dig.&nbsp; The first of  these changes is that Scorekeeper and Referee certifications are no longer  conducted at local tournaments.&nbsp; In order  to be certified in one or both of these positions, you must contact NAGVA (see  their website for details &ndash; <a href="http://www.nagva.org/">www.nagva.org</a>)  as everything is conducted via the internet now.&nbsp; The second change is that players are  required to play at their rating level or higher.&nbsp; No longer may a team play with one player  rated at a higher level.</p>
