<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    What follow are the rules and guidelines that will be applied to the 2011 Summer
    Friday Leagues (both 4&#39;s and 2&#39;s). Items in <font color="blue">blue</font> are notable differences
    between
    4&#39;s/2&#39;s rules and 6&#39;s rules.
    <p />
    1. Matches are comprised of two games played to 21
    using rally scoring (every time the ball is ruled dead results in a point). A
    team must win by at least two points with a cap of 23.
    <p />
    2. All matches will be
    allotted 30 minutes, including an optional 5-minute warm up period. If time
    expires, teams should complete the point, and the team that is ahead after that
    point wins the game.
    <p />
    3. First serve will be determined by rock/paper/scissors
    (on 3, not after 3). The team that wins will have the choice of first serve or
    court, with the remaining choice going to the other team.
    <p />
    4. Teams will
    alternate first serve regardless of which team wins the first game.
    <p />
    5. All matches will be self-reffing. Please be honest and call yourself and/or your
    teammates for any rule violations. You may call a violation on the opposing
    team, but please do so courteously. Any questions, conflicts, or issues with
    self-reffing should be brought to the League Director.
    <p />
    <font color="blue">6. All players are
    considered front row the entire match (i.e. a player is still able to hit in the
    front row even if he/she just served; there are no backrow attacks).</font>
    <p />
    7. Foot
    faults while serving (stepping on or over the line prior to making contact with
    the ball) are not allowed.
    <p />
    8. You may not block or attack a serve.
    <p />
    9. You may
    not carry/lift the ball, which includes palming or throwing the ball on a hit.
    <p />
    10. You may not &quot;roof&quot; (blocker's hands extending over the net and breaking the
    plane of the net when the setter is setting the ball for an offensive play). A
    blocker may extend his/her hands over the net when 1) the ball is above the
    height of the net AND 2) is being attacked by the opponent (a hit or if the
    setter is dumping the ball).
    <p />
    11. You may not touch the top tape of the net
    during play. Incidental contact with the net away from where the ball is being
    played is acceptable.
    <p />
    <font color="blue">12. You may travel completely under the net, provided you
    make no contact with a player on the opposing team and do not interfere with the
    opposing team&#39;s play.</font>
    <p />
    <font color="blue">13. Players are not required to rotate positions during
    the course of play, but must serve in the correct order.</font>
    <p />
    14. If the ball hits
    the ceiling on your side of the net and comes down on your side, it is playable,
    provided your team has at least one contact left. If it hits on your side and
    comes down on your opponents&#39; side or if it hits the ceiling of your opponent&#39;s
    side at any time during your play, it is out of bounds.
    <p />
    15. If the ball contacts
    a side wall or divider, it is considered out of bounds. Page 2 of 2
    <p />
    <font color="blue">16. When
    contacting the ball with one hand, the ball must be cleanly hit with 1) the heel
    or palm of the hand (roll shot), 2) straight, locked fingertips (cobra), or
    knurled fingers (camel-toe), 3) a closed fist, or 4) the back of the hand.
    One-handed placement or redirection of the ball with the fingers (dink or
    open-hand tip) is not permitted.</font>
    <p />
    17. Sets must leave the setter&#39;s hands cleanly
    without multiple contacts on the ball.
    <p />
    <font color="blue">18. A setter may set the ball over the
    net (forward or backward), provided his/her shoulders are perpendicular to the
    path of the ball. Side or directional sets are not permitted over the net, but
    may be used when setting a fellow teammate on your side of the net.</font>
    <p />
    19. &quot;Let&quot;
    serves, where the ball makes contact with the net on serve, are legal.
    <p />
    20. A
    ball may be played back to your own side of the net if it has crossed over the
    net, under the net, or outside the antenna, as long as your team has one or more
    contacts left and the ball is played back under the net or outside the antenna.
    <p />
    21. The first contact on the ball any time it comes over the net may be
    double-hit by a single player and still counted as a single contact.
    <p />
    22. The
    ball may be played with any part of the body.
    <p />
    23. A touch on a block is not
    considered one of the three contacts allowed per team, nor does it prevent the
    blocker from making immediate secondary contact with the ball, which would be
    considered the first of the three contacts.
    <p />
    24. A player may only have one toss
    per serve attempt. Catching a toss or allowing it to hit the floor will result
    in a side-out.
    <p />
    25. You may not prevent the opposing team, through screening,
    from seeing the server or the path of the ball. At an opponent&#39;s request, a
    player must move sideways, bend over, or bend down.
    <p />
    <font color="blue">26. 4&#39;s will be played on a
    full-sized indoor court. 2&#39;s will be played on a court with a 4&#39; reduction in
    depth on each side of the net.</font>
