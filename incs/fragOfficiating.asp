	<p>CGVA requires that each team have one certified referee so  that matches in CGVA leagues are officiated in a fair and consistent manner.  CGVA provides two levels of certification: <em>recreational division</em> and <em>upper  division.</em> In addition, CGVA accepts certification by outside bodies such as  NAGVA or USA Volleyball, which are equivalent to upper division certification  for league purposes.</p>
	<b><font class='cfont12'>CGVA League Rules</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>CGVA&rsquo;s leagues follow the current  (2009-11) USA Volleyball rulebook, which can be reviewed at this link:<br /> <a href="../CGVADOCS/LEAGUE/USAV Indoor Rules 2009-11.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="../IMAGES/pdf.gif">USA Volleyball indoor  rules</a>. </p>
    <p><font class='cfont10'><a href="http://www.cgva.org/index.asp?PAGE=LeagueRules">CGVA&rsquo;s league rules</a> state the following:</p>
    <blockquote> <b><font class='cfont12'>OFFICIATING</b>
        <p><font class='cfont10'>Official volleyball rules will be  followed as set forth by the current USAV rulebook and adapted NAGVA rules.  Teams scheduled to officiate must provide four players to constitute a full  officiating crew. Please, also have a personal whistle, or obtain a CGVA  whistle before the match begins. If the officiating team does not make its  assignment, they will forfeit one game for each officiating game missed. Each  team must have a minimum of 1 certified referee on their roster. Officiating  clinics will be conducted during open play nights prior to the start of the  regular season. A team has the first three weeks of a season to get a player  certified to officiate. After that point in time, a team will forfeit all games  until a player is certified. If the certified referee is absent, a substitute  certified referee may be obtained. The substitute referee must be approved by  both captains of the participating teams prior to beginning the match. An  officiating team cannot cause a delay with the games they are scheduled to  officiate. Other responsibilities of the certified official include, but are  not limited to: </p>
      <ol>
          <li><font class='cfont10'>Selecting  an MVP from each team at the conclusion of the match.</li>
        <li><font class='cfont10'>Signing  the score sheet at the conclusion of the match.</li>
        <li><font class='cfont10'>Obtaining  the signature/initials of each participating captain at the conclusion of the  match.</li>
        <li><font class='cfont10'>Conducting  the pre-match captain&rsquo;s meeting.</li>
        <li><font class='cfont10'>Keeping  the matches on-time with the provided time schedule and calling &ldquo;TIME&rdquo; when the  allotted time expires.</li>
      </ol>

    <b><font class='cfont12'>Summary of Changes from the USAV 2009-2011 Rules</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>With NAGVA's and CGVA's adoption of USAV 2009-11 rules, there are several significant changes in comparison to the 2007-08 rules previously in effect. CGVA has created a summary to help you understand these rules changes that can be <a href="../CGVADOCS/LEAGUE/Summary of Rules Changes for 2009-11.doc" target="_blank">reviewed at this link</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <b><font class='cfont12'>CGVA&rsquo;s Referee Certification  Process</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>CGVA&rsquo;s referee certification process consists of three  steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><font class='cfont10'>Attend  a referee certification clinic (offered at the beginning of each season).</li>
      <li><font class='cfont10'>Pass  the division-specific written exam with a score of at least 80%.</li>
      <li><font class='cfont10'>Pass  the practical, observation while officiating a full two-game match, at a  proficiency appropriate to your division.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>CGVA requires that referee certification be completed by the  end of week 3 of the regular league season. We recommend that you study and  complete your test in the week immediately following the clinic so that you can  be scheduled for the practical exam in week 2 or 3 of league play.</p>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>For questions regarding CGVA&rsquo;s referee certification, please contact your league director. </p>
    <b><font class='cfont12'>Referee Training Presentation</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>The following excellent referee training presentation was prepared by Glo Bailey and Ryan MacDowell for CGVA. It is highly recommended viewing for all CGVA referees.</p>

    <b><font class='cfont12'>Your Responsibilities as a  Certified Referee</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>CGVA&rsquo;s league rules spell out many of your responsibilities.  Remember, as the certified referee for your team, you must fulfill the duties  of <em>first referee </em>(also known as the <em>up ref</em>). You cannot have a  non-certified team member fill in for you. And you cannot find an substitute,  certified ref to fill in for you so that you can play as a sub for another  team.</p>
    <b><font class='cfont12'>NAGVA vs. CGVA Certification</b>
    <p><font class='cfont10'>Previously, CGVA was able to offer certification that was  recognized and recorded by NAGVA. However, with the introduction of NAGVA&rsquo;s  self-service clinic and exam available in the fall of 2008,  CGVA&rsquo;s clinics and exam no longer qualify the referee for NAGVA certification.  Nevertheless, the upper division exam is still excellent preparation for NAGVA certification.  Moreover, NAGVA certification remains valid for CGVA leagues and qualifies a  player at the <em>upper division</em> level.</p>
