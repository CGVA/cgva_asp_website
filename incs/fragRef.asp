	The diagram to the left represents the player positions on the volleyball court. In some questions, there is reference to the <em>serving team (A) </em>and the <em>receiving team (B)</em>. The corresponding positions are labeled <em>A1</em> for the player in the serving position on the serving team, or <em>B1</em> for the player in the serving position on the receiving team. <em>R1</em> represents the <em>first referee</em> (up ref); <em>R2</em> represents the <em>second referee</em> (down ref).

<p>At the time the ball is served by A1, B1 can be standing at the net, and B2 can be at the back line.</p>
<p>A ball that does not rebound off the hands of a player passing the ball is considered a catch. </p>
<p>A player may make a double contact on any first team contact.</p>
<p>After the team serving first loses the rally, the receiving team does not rotate before serving for the first time.</p>
<p>When using rally point scoring, a point is awarded after every serve.</p>
<p>B6 passes the ball hit over the net from Team A. Then B3 sets the ball to B2 who passes the ball to B4 who hits it over the net and onto the floor in Team A's court. This is a point for Team B.</p>
<p>During a rally, B3 hits the ball over the net. Player A6 is at the net and jumps, contacting the ball above the net and blocking it down onto the floor on Team B's side. The point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>Team A hits the ball towards Team B's court. The ball hits the outside edge of the sideline. The point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>Player B5 passes the ball over the net to Team A's side. While crossing the net, the ball passes directly over the antennae. The line judge signals the ball out, and the point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>Player B3 is the team captain. After a double call, player B1 screams at the referee that it was the first contact and should not have been called as a double. The first referee (R1) should change his call based on B1's assertion.</p>
<p>The ball comes over the net to Team B. B1 passes the ball to the setter, B3, who sets the ball. B6 jumps from in front of the three-meter line and contacts the ball when it's entirely above the height of the net, hits the ball down onto Team A's court. Team A scores a point.</p>
<p>Team A is serving when they lose a rally. During Team B's last possession of the ball, B3 was serving. Now, B5 goes back and after authorization for service, B5 contacts the ball. The first referee (R1) blows her whistle and signals out of rotation. The point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>Player B3 hits the ball over the net, A2 and A3 go up to block, and make light contact with the ball. This is considered the first contact.</p>
<p>Players A2 and A3 are blocking a ball hit by B4. Player A6 is the setter and contacts the net as she moves to get back into position. This is considered incidental contact and play is allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Player B4 goes up to block a hit from A2. When landing, the right foot of player B4 lands on the line under the net. This is considered under the net and the point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>Player B1 is going back to serve. He serves the ball while it is resting in his hand. The first referee (R1) whistles and indicates loss of rally. The point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>The first referee (R1) whistles and beckons for serve. The server is talking to another player about positioning. R1 blows her whistle again, awards the ball to the other team, and signals eight-second violation.</p>
<p>Team A serves a short ball that would land in the front zone. Player B4 takes advantage of the serve and jumps, attacking the ball while it is entirely above the height of the net and in front of the three-meter line. B4 hits the ball onto the floor in Team A's. The first referee (R1) whistles, awards the point to Team A, and signals illegal attack.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous question, Team A serves a short ball that would land in the front zone. Player B4 jumps and blocks the ball above the height of the net, causing the ball to land in the court on Team A's side. The point goes to Team B.</p>
<p>The second referee (R2) sees a player commit a double contact on a play. Since the player's back is to the first referee (R1), R2 blows his whistle, stopping the game. This is OK since R1 did not have a good view of the play.</p>
<p>On the second contact by Team A, the ball touches the ceiling above the court on Team B's side. The ball rebounds to Team A's side where player A4 makes the team's third contact and hits the ball to the floor on Team B's side. The point goes to Team A.</p>
<p>On the second contact by Team A, the ball touches the ceiling above the court on Team A's side. Player A4 makes the team's third contact and hits the ball to the floor on Team B's side. The point goes to Team A.</p>
