    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; color: red">
    <br>
    </span></b><font face="Arial">A &amp; R exists to meet the needs of our Clients by 
    providing, with the highest quality and integrity, personalized tax 
    services. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">We will aim for-and 
    reach-superior, measurable standards of quality with every product we 
    deliver and every service we provide.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Our Clients will regard us not only as 
    professional, but also as a trusted friend and ally, as in the pursuit of 
    their financial dreams.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">The A &amp; R name is synonymous with 
    superior service-superior not in quality and quantity, but also in spirit. 
    Mere adequacy of quality and quantity of service is not sufficient to 
    satisfy the commitment we have made to our clients. In fact, it’s the spirit 
    in which we deliver our service that makes us unique. In large part, it is 
    this spirit which accounts for the A &amp; R difference.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">
        <span style="color: navy; font-weight: 700">A &amp; R MAKES A DIFFERENCE</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:red">THE A &amp; R 
    INTERVIEW</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">There is a difference in having 
    your tax return completed by an A &amp; R professional, and that difference 
    begins with the interview – the most thorough you ever have experienced. In 
    addition, A &amp; R Bookkeeping &amp; Tax Service is backed by the latest knowledge 
    about the IRS laws &amp; changes by attending the latest seminars &amp; forums &amp; by 
    having a thorough library of all the IRS, the FTB, the EDD &amp; the SBOE 
    publications which cover almost every imaginable tax related personal and 
    occupational situation.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:red"><br>
    IN-DEPTH REVIEW</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Once your interview forms have 
    been completed, they then are reviewed both for mathematical accuracy and 
    for the proper of tax theory, as it applies to you. Nothing is taken for 
    granted. We take pride in our work and demand total accuracy in each phase 
    of the preparation of your return.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:red">COMPUTER 
    PROCESSING</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Next, your return is processed 
    through a state-of-the-art computer system designed to provide another total 
    review. Not only are the mathematical calculations checked automatically, 
    but a process is initiated that assures you the lowest possible tax 
    computation allowable for your return. The computer then prints the 
    completed information on the required federal and state forms. Your return 
    is assembled in quadruplicate-one set for your federal filing, one set for 
    your state filing (if required), one for your own file and the set for A &amp; 
    R’s confidential file, available if yours ever is misplaced or destroyed.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:red">A FINAL 
    REVIEW</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">After the computer processing, 
    your return is checked one more time-prior to the preparer signing it-to 
    assure that we have produced a tax return that reflects the lowest tax to 
    which you are entitled-arithmetically correct, technically correct.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:red"><br>
    PEACE OF MIND</span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Most of our first-time clients 
    tells us their A &amp; R tax return is the most professional they have ever 
    received. Our long-term clients take this quality for granted.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">We offer the industry’s finest 
    service, available year-round to all clients. This means that you have the 
    peace of mind of knowing that you have received every tax advantage legally 
    available to you. And you know that these tax advantages have been included 
    in a tax return that has been checked not once, not twice, but triple 
    checked for your protection. And you know that your&nbsp; A &amp; R professional 
    will be available to you for tax counseling year-round, whenever you need 
    him or her, and at no extra cost.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial">Your tax peace of mind is a vital 
    part of the A &amp; R difference.</font></p>
